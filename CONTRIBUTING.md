## Contributing
  
Here’s how we suggest you go about proposing a change to this project:
  
1. [Fork this project][fork] to your account.
2. [Create a branch][branch] for the change you intend to make.
3. Make your changes to your fork.
4. [Send a pull request][pr] from your fork’s branch to our `master` branch.
  
Using the web-based interface to make changes is fine too, and will help you
by automatically forking the project and prompting to send a pull request too.
